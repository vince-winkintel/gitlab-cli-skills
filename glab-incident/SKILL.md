## Quick start

```bash
glab incident --help

# Comment with a local attachment
glab incident note 123 --message "Current dashboard state" --attach ./dashboard.png
```

## Attach files to incident comments

The experimental `--attach <path>` flag uploads a file to the incident's project and appends the returned Markdown reference to the comment. Repeat it for multiple files. An attachment can be the entire comment and skips the editor; `--attach -` reads the attachment from standard input.

## Subcommands

See [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for full `--help` output.

# glab securefile

## Overview

```

  Store up to 100 files for secure use in CI/CD pipelines. Secure files are                                             
  stored outside of your project's repository, not in version control.                                                  
  It is safe to store sensitive information in these files. Both plain text                                             
  and binary files are supported, but they must be smaller than 5 MB.
